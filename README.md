===================
Various scripts I've thrown together. Repo name courtesy of GitHub RNG (with love)

I make no guarantee that any files are complete or ever will be. Use at your own risk. I'm not responsible if anything breaks

There are probably better ways to do everything in this repository...

>Test script to get dropbox sync working (I wanted a backup in case something went wrong, so I don't run directly from dropbox)

**/server/launcher/willie.sh**
>Logic script to manage the bot easily
