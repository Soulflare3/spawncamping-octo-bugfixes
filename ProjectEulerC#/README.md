Each filename -.cs is a problemID at Project Euler, example: https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

Language: C#
These are "Command Line" programs.
Done using Visual Studio 2013

These programs could easily be shortened, I just leave in information that I use while I'm debugging (for example, printing values of my variables at various points).
I also hate Console.WriteLine()
So I alias it as print() instead. :)
